# Introduction
I want to import football play data from a comma-separated values file and store it as a matrix represented as a list of lists.

# Import dependencies
```{python}
import csv
```

# Functions
```{python}
def read_comma_separated_values_as_matrix(filename: str):
    """Read a comma separated values file into a matrix represented as a list of lists.

    Arguments:
        filename (str): The name of the comma separated values file to import.
    Returns:
        (list): This list of lists contains the data from the comma separated values file.
    """
    with open(filename, 'rt') as file_handle:
        # Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30076209/import-csv-file-into-a-matrix-array-in-python
        reader = csv.reader(file_handle)
        data_as_list_of_lists = list(reader)
        return data_as_list_of_lists     
```

# Methods
I will read the football plays data from the comma separated values file into a list of lists and then check the length of the outer list and the first inner list as a validation measure.
```{python}
football_plays_filename = "football-plays-2024.csv"
football_plays_matrix = read_comma_separated_values_as_matrix(football_plays_filename)
print(f"This matrix contains ({len(football_plays_matrix)}) rows and ({len(football_plays_matrix[0])}) columns.")
```
