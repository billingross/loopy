# and the willing oblige.

A strapping European man in a skimpy workout fit sits down next to me at the bar. "It looks we are a couple.", he offers with jockular enthusiasm. The synapses of my mind fan out in a wave, exploring the universe of unexpected possibilities reaching out in spacetime ahead of me. I hesitate for a moment to reflect on my decision to sit in a seat next to one already reserved. The bartended had registered my reticence when I approached the bar. "That one is open". Yes, but how open?

"Now it does". Being party to someone expressing their insecurities reminds me of seeing a cat walk in front of me and start to lick its own butthole. It is a normal and hygenic protocol for the cat and it also chose to do it in front of me. What role do I fill in the play of this cat? Does it feel some sense of shame or some hidden desire for intimacy? I wonder if shame is always tied to sex. Freud expressed that. Hold onto my ego while you perform your strange ritual and see that I am largely unphased by the experience. Now let me watch you remain visibly unharmed while I unfurl my freak flag so that I may release my freak sphincter.

# Welcome to my blog!

## Images
I went for a walk in Forest Park.

![Image 1. A screenshot of my phone screen while I tried to capture an image of a spider spinning a web in the woods. Text at the top reads "Trying to capture this spider spinning their web and too small :(". Text in the bottom right corner reads "hat tip to @jdan". The thumbnail of the previous image in my photos catalogue is of Mina Kimes at the 2025 ESPY Awards.](spider-spinning.png)

![Image 2. An image of a slug on the forest floor next to a puddle of Mayan Mocha and a white paper coffee cup. The slug has a hole in its side. Overlain text at the bottom reads "Hey pal, I see that you have a hole. Care for some mayan mocha frap?"](slug-1.png)

![Image 3. Another image of the same slug who in the process of slurping up Mayan Mocha is captioned, "My boy (gender neutral) is about to turn into Shai-Hulud". Shai-Hulud is the name of the giant sandworm in the fictional Dune canon.](slug-2.png)

As I stood in the park editing these images in markdown, a bald eagle cried out above me. "That is a bald eagle!", exclaimed a child. I did not see the bald eagle because I was intently focussed on my phone.
