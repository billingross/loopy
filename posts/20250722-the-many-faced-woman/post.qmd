# Introduction
While traversing an unorthodox path, [Mina Kimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina_Kimes) has become the foremost expert in data-driven football analysis. She expresses her football insights on [The Mina Kimes Show featuring Lenny](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-mina-kimes-show-featuring-lenny/id1437647915) podcast and the [NFL Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Live) television show regularly airing on ESPN. Through these media she shares the results of her analyses in the form of picks and predictions. She also shares detailed contextual descriptions of the methods and data she uses to generate her results. In sharing her process with her audience she provides them with tools to perform their own analyses and generate their own opinions. And in turn she is rewarded by her empowered fans who share their insights in the comments sections of her various social media profiles.

Give a fan a fish and they will have to wait for you to give them another fish before they can again satiate their fish delights. Teach a fan to fish and they will realized that fish are available for purchase at restaurants and markets right now, no wading.

I am not sure why her fans consume her football content. I fell in love with watching her discuss the intersection of sports with social issues as a panelist on the now cancelled ESPN show, [Around the Horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_Horn). Her podcast contains a lot of technical minutiae about football. I can tell you which division the Carolina Panthers play in and I cannot tell you the name of the quarterback generally expect to start the season. I can tell you that they recently drafted a quarterback who looked about as tall as Mina Kimes in heels.

I work with lists and data structures and so when I encounter the rhetorical urge to wedgie these football nerds I try to remember that I too can get excited by numbers. And it comes down to predictive power. Tell me the numbers that will win. I do not care who you are or where you came from if you can tell me the numbers that will empower me to become the god king that I always dreamed I could be. Tell me the numbers before they appear on the screen so that I can win friends and influence people.

A problem with this approach is that I can only every hope to be the second person to make a prediction. If you are not first then you are last. Ask Shams Charania. I want my own football model and I do not want to have to learn about gap schemes and safeties who are in too deep. Why would I? If I can find out who is good at making predictions then I can use them as my model.

Style indicates substance and Mina Kimes has style. So how good is her stuff? I want to find out. Now go nominate The Mina Kimes Show featuring Lenny for Peoples Choice and Best Female Hosted Podcast at the [Podcast Awards](https://www.podcastawards.com/). You never know who may be watching.
