    "text": "A strapping European man in a skimpy workout fit sits down next to me at the bar. “It looks we are a couple.”, he offers with jockular enthusiasm. The synapses of my mind fan out in a wave, exploring the universe of unexpected possibilities reaching out in spacetime ahead of me. I hesitate for a moment to reflect on my decision to sit in a seat next to one already reserved. The bartended had registered my reticence when I approached the bar. “That one is open”. Yes, but how open?\n“Now it does”. Being party to someone expressing their insecurities reminds me of seeing a cat walk in front of me and start to lick its own butthole. It is a normal and hygenic protocol for the cat and it also chose to do it in front of me. What role do I fill in the play of this cat? Does it feel some sense of shame or some hidden desire for intimacy? I wonder if shame is always tied to sex. Freud expressed that. Hold onto my ego while you perform your strange ritual and see that I am largely unphased by the experience. Now let me watch you remain visibly unharmed while I unfurl my freak flag so that I may release my freak sphincter."

The thumbnail of the previous image in my photos catalogue is of Mina Kimes at the 2025 ESPY Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 2. An image of a slug on the forest floor next to a puddle of Mayan Mocha and a white paper coffee cup. The slug has a hole in its side. Overlain text at the bottom reads “Hey pal, I see that you have a hole. Care for some mayan mocha frap?”\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 3. Another image of the same slug who in the process of slurping up Mayan Mocha is captioned, “My boy (gender neutral) is about to turn into Shai-Hulud”. Shai-Hulud is the name of the giant sandworm in the fictional Dune canon.\n\n\nAs I stood in the park editing these images in markdown, a bald eagle cried out above me. “That is a bald eagle!”, exclaimed a child. I did not see the bald eagle because I was intently focussed on my phone."

    "text": "Image 1. The face of Mina Kimes is superimposed over a screenshot of Jaqen H’ghar from the television series Game of Thrones. A text box in the top left corner reads “The Many Faced Woman”.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nWhile traversing an unorthodox path, Mina Kimes has become the foremost expert in data-driven football analysis. She expresses her football insights on The Mina Kimes Show featuring Lenny podcast and the NFL Live television show regularly airing on ESPN. Through these media she shares the results of her analyses in the form of picks and predictions. She also shares detailed contextual descriptions of the methods and data she uses to generate her results. In sharing her process with her audience she provides them with tools to perform their own analyses and generate their own opinions. And in turn she is rewarded by her empowered fans who share their insights in the comments sections of her various social media profiles.\n\n\n\nImage 2. A screenshot from one of her TikToks where Mina Kimes looks nonplussed as she scrolls through Tom Brady comments.\n\n\nGive a fan a fish and they will have to wait for you to give them another fish before they can again satiate their fish delights. Teach a fan to fish and they will realized that fish are available for purchase at restaurants and markets right now, no wading.\nI am not sure why her fans consume her football content. I fell in love with watching her discuss the intersection of sports with social issues as a panelist on the now cancelled ESPN show, Around the Horn. Her podcast contains a lot of technical minutiae about football. I can tell you which division the Carolina Panthers play in and I cannot tell you the name of the quarterback generally expect to start the season. I can tell you that they recently drafted a quarterback who looked about as tall as Mina Kimes in heels.\n\n\n\nImage 3. A somewhat dark and grainy image of quarterback Bryce Young standing next to Mina Kimes in a neon lit outdoor covered walkway.\n\n\nI work with lists and data structures and so when I encounter the rhetorical urge to wedgie these football nerds I try to remember that I too can get excited by numbers. And it comes down to predictive power. Tell me the numbers that will win. I do not care who you are or where you came from if you can tell me the numbers that will empower me to become the god king that I always dreamed I could be. Tell me the numbers before they appear on the screen so that I can win friends and influence people.\nA problem with this approach is that I can only every hope to be the second person to make a prediction. If you are not first then you are last. Ask Shams Charania. I want my own football model and I do not want to have to learn about gap schemes and safeties who are in too deep. Why would I? If I can find out who is good at making predictions then I can use them as my model.\n\n\n\nImage 4. Side by side images of Kay Adams and Shams Charania from her interview of him on the “Up & Adams” show. Source: https://nypost.com/2022/11/18/kay-adams-jokingly-flirts-with-nba-insider-shams-charania/.\n\n\nStyle indicates substance and Mina Kimes has style. So how good is her stuff? I want to find out. Now go nominate The Mina Kimes Show featuring Lenny for Peoples Choice and Best Female Hosted Podcast at the Podcast Awards. You never know who may be watching.\n\n\n\nImage 5. A vaguely Mina Kimes-looking face peers at you from their reflection in the bottom of right corner of what appears to be an Etch-a-Sketch."

In Python I represent a matrix as a list of lists.\nIn the parlance of relational databases a row-oriented database is one where all of the dimensions of a particular thing are linked together. In this dataset each row in the comma separated values table corresponds to a single play in a football game. My data will initially be row-oriented because Python reads files line-by-line. This means that each list in my matrix will contain all of the metrics for one particular play.\nThis is not particularly useful for me because I want to identify patterns within each dimension of data and use those dimensions to make predictions. I want to transform my dataset to by column-oriented so that I can do that. A column-oriented database is one where all of the values of a particular metric are stored together which makes it easier to pick out only the metrics I am interested in and use statistics to measure them. Instead of each list in my matrix storing all the metrics for a particular play I will organize it so that each list stores all the vales for a particular metric such as Yards.\n\nRead the data into a row-oriented matrix\nI will read the football plays data from the comma separated values file into a list of lists and then check the length of the outer list and the first inner list as a validation measure.\n\nfootball_plays_filename = \"football-plays-2024.csv\"\nrow_oriented_matrix = read_comma_separated_values_as_matrix(football_plays_filename)\nprint(f\"This matrix contains ({len(row_oriented_matrix)}) rows and ({len(row_oriented_matrix[0])}) columns.\")\n\nThis matrix contains (53284) rows and (45) columns.\n\n\n\n\nTranspose matrix so that it is column-oriented\n\ncolumnar_matrix = transpose_matrix(row_oriented_matrix)\nprint(f\"This matrix contains ({len(columnar_matrix)}) columns and ({len(columnar_matrix[0])}) rows.\")\n\nThis matrix contains (45) columns and (53284) rows."
